# CurrencyConverter

An Android app, written in Java. It is made for the Udemy course, The Complete Android N Developer Course by Rob Percival. The goal is to make a currency converter from Euros to Dollars.

## What I learned

* Developed a UI within the activity_main.xml using RelativeLayout, EditText, ImageView, Button and Textview.
* Implemented functionality to the UI using: onCreate and convertToEuro.
* Used Toast message to return the result of the conversion.
